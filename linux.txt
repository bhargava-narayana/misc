/arch -> platform code (32/64 bit; big/little endian)
/kernel /mm -> core kernel (low-level arch support and high level funcions)
asm-generic -> generic core header functions needed for higher level kernel code/arch unification
/arch/<arch>/boot/ -> target location of vmlinux.bin
/arch/<arch>/configs/ -> defconfig example
/arch/<arch>/include/ -> asm directory
/arch/<arch>/Kconfig -> standard kernel config data (debug version: Kconfig.debug)
/arch/<arch>/kernel/head.S -> low-level asembly entry point
/arch/<arch>/kernel/irq.c -> interrupt bits
/arch/<arch>/kernel/module.c -> ELF module loader bits

/etc/crontab -> cron's config files
/usr/share/doc -> README's for installed kernel.
/etc/init.d or /etc/rc.d -> init config

/proc -> directory preceded /sys, and it has basically all details about running processes. Over time, more files were added to it, mostly "virtual" ones, which don't actually exist, but are created on the fly if you try to access them.

/sys -> is more modern. introduced more order and a better structure than provided by the older /proc. Many of the files (but not all) in /proc are duplicated in /sys, and whenever possible, you should pick the files in the latter directory.Subdirectories:
        /sys/block/ -> an entry pointing to each block device.
        /sys/bus/ -> directories for each bus type, and within each, two subdirectories:
        /sys/bus/devices/ -> has a directory for each device, pointing to the device's directory in /root
        /sys/bus/drivers/ -> has a directory for each driver that was loaded for devices on the given bus.
        /sys/class/ -> has directories for each type of object; some examples are block/, graphics/, net/, sound/ and so on.
        /sys/dev/ -> provides directories for each type of device (for example, dev/block/ or dev/char/), each with directories for each appropriate device.
        /sys/devices/ -> contains the global device hierarchy, with every physical device in your system.
        /sys/firmware/ -> includes directories for firmware-specific objects; for example, acpi/ or memmap/
        /sys/fs/ -> has a directory for each filesystem type in your machine, each with further directories for each specific device; for example, I have /sys/fs/ext4/sda2, because the disk mounted as /dev/sda2 uses ext4.
        /sys/kernel/ -> has several files related to the currently loaded kernel.
        /sys/module/ -> has a subdirectory for each and every module loaded into the kernel.
        /sys/power/ -> represents the power subsystem.

/boot/config-$(uname -r) or /proc/config.gz -> running kernel config

arch ->The arch subdirectory contains all of the architecture specific kernel code. It has further subdirectories, one per supported architecture.

include -> The include subdirectory contains most of the include files needed to build the kernel code. It too has further subdirectories including one for every architecture supported. 
include/asm -> a soft link to the real include directory needed for this architecture. To change architectures you need to edit the kernel makefile and rerun the Linux kernel configuration program. 

init -> This directory contains the initialization code for the kernel and it is a very good place to start looking at how the kernel works. 

mm -> This directory contains all of the memory management code. The architecture specific memory management code lives down in arch/*/mm/

drivers -> All of the system's device drivers live in this directory. They are further sub-divided into classes of device driver.

ipc -> This directory contains the kernels inter-process communications code. 

modules ->This is simply a directory used to hold built modules. 

fs -> All of the file system code. This is further sub-divided into directories, one per supported file system.

kernel -> The main kernel code. Again, the architecture specific kernel code is in arch/*/kernel. 

net -> The kernel's networking code. 

lib -> This directory contains the kernel's library code. The architecture specific library code can be found in arch/*/lib/. 

scripts -> This directory contains the scripts used when the kernel is configured. 


RAMDISK 
        - ramdisk  image is a file that contains an image of an  ext2  filesystem,  while  a  ramdisk  object  is  an  elf  object  that encapsulates  a  ramdisk  image and  can  be  linked  into  the  kernel.  The  ramdisk  image  is  usually  stored  in  compressed  form.
        - CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM and CONFIG_BLK_DEV_INITRD. 
        - a ramdisk can be mounted as the root file system.

Service Ports
VNC     5800/5900
telnet  3000

ELF -> Executable Linkable Format; similar to bin but with additional information.
LKCD -> Linux Kernel Crash Dump; /etc/rc.sysinit

Pseduo Terminals:       Pseudo terminals are pairs of devices such as /dev/ptyp3 and /dev/ttyp3. There is no physical device directly associated with either of them. If a program treats ttyp3 like it was a serial port, what is read and written to that port appears on the other member of the pair ptyp3 which another program uses to read and write to. Thus two programs talk to each other via this method and one program on ttyp3 thinks it's talking to a serial port.

terminals (in /dev):
ttyI<N>   ISDN drvr pkg. Emulates a modem
tty<N>    console/terminals (tty - teletypes)      
vc/<N>    virtual consoles. Alias to ttyN
pts       filesystems of type devpts/mounted filesystems
pty/pts   pseduo terminals
ttyS<N>   serial console/COM<N> port

mknod:  create a device (ls -l /dev provides major/minor numbers of existing devices)
/etc/ioctl.save -> stores stty settings for use in console single user modew
ps -l - list termianls in use
ltsp - Linux Terminal Server Project / terminal server 

setserial-terminal util thats deals with actual serial ports
stty-terminal util that abstracts actual access method
strace -> util to show all syscalls made by a prg.(e.g gcc -Wall -o hello hello.c)

/mm (memory manager) :

        - vm_struct - virtual mem struct
        - communicates with FS using shared data and procedure calls (swap information struct and I-node struct)

/kernel: responsible for duties relating to managing processes.
        - after init communicates with /mm with procedure calls for
                1. alloc mem for modules that are loaded and processes that are forked
                2. gather sys mem usage info
                3. verify ownership of various portions of mem during sys calls (e.g. sys_signal) using  verify_area
/arc/<platform>/kernel: responsible for interrupt mgmt, low-level process creation/termination, shutdown, BIOS interaction, etc.
